glimpse(tidy_grades)
```

```{r}
tidy_grades %>%
  group_by(instructor, subject_code, course_code) %>%
  filter(sum(quantity)>100,
         course_code >= 200 & course_code <= 800) %>%

            median_grade = median(rep(grade, quantity))) %>%

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
